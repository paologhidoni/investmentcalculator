# INVESTMENT CALCULATOR

## Goals:

- Build an interactive investment calculator.

## Components:

- **Header** (+Logo)
- **InputForm**
- **InvestmentChart** (using `HighCharts` for React)
- **InvestmentData** (responsive table using `grid` & `tailwind`)

## Extra:

- Make the _annual investment_ variable so that the chart reflects the changes dynamically.
